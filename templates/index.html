            This web app helps you figure out that word on the tip of your tongue by using a model similar to the
            game of 20 Questions! After choosing a part of speech and a word that's "kinda close" to the word on the
            tip of the tongue, 20Q Thesaurus will present synonyms and ask you to select the one closer to what you're
            thinking of, repeating this process until you figure out what the heck that word was!
